## Overview
Optimizing RAG retrieval latency is critical for production applications where user experience depends on fast response times. This skill covers techniques to reduce query latency at every stage: indexing, embedding generation, search execution, and result processing.

## Problem Statement
RAG systems often have latency issues:
- Vector search operations take hundreds of milliseconds
- Embedding generation adds significant per-query overhead
- Network round trips between services compound delays
- Cold starts cause unpredictable latency spikes
- Trade-offs between accuracy and speed are unclear

## Key Concepts
- **Query Path**: Full journey from user request to retrieved results
- **Hot Path Optimization**: Focus on frequently executed operations
- **Cold Path**: Infrequent operations where accuracy matters more than speed
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching for repeated queries and embeddings
- **Index Tuning**: Balancing recall, build time, and search speed

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Measure Current Performance
Establish baseline measurements before optimization.

**Why**: You can't optimize what you don't measure. Profiling reveals the actual bottlenecks rather than assumptions.

### Step 2: Optimize Embedding Generation
Reduce the overhead of generating query embeddings.

**Why**: Embedding generation is often the bottleneck - caching reduces this overhead for repeated queries.

### Step 3: Optimize Vector Database Operations
Tune indexing and search parameters for latency.

**Why**: Index parameters directly impact search latency, lower `ef` values reduce search time at the cost of recall.

### Step 4: Implement Multi-Level Caching
Cache at multiple levels to reduce redundant work.

**Why**: Multi-level caching reduces computation for repeated queries without sacrificing freshness for unique queries.

### Step 5: Optimize Result Processing
Stream results and minimize post-processing overhead.

**Why**: Streaming reduces memory usage and allows users to see results sooner, improving perceived latency.

### Step 6: Implement Query Prioritization
Prioritize and batch queries for better resource utilization.

**Why**: Query prioritization ensures important queries get resources first and reduces contention.

## When to Use This Skill
- Production RAG systems with latency SLAs
- High-traffic applications (> 100 QPS)
- When user experience is critical
- Systems with repeat queries
- Resource-constrained environments

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Early prototyping (premature optimization)
- Very low traffic (< 1 QPS)
- When accuracy is more important than speed
- For one-off batch operations
