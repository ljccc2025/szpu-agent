## Overview
This example describes how a multi-agent RAG system should be structured without embedding a large implementation directly in the repository. Use it when a single retrieve-then-answer flow is no longer sufficient and different agent roles need to collaborate.

## Goal
Coordinate specialized agents so that query understanding, retrieval, reranking, synthesis, and validation can be separated into distinct responsibilities.

## Reference Architecture

```text
User Query
  -> Orchestrator
    -> Query Analysis Agent
    -> Retrieval Agent
    -> Reranking Agent
    -> Synthesis Agent
    -> Optional Critique / Verification Agent
  -> Final Answer + Sources + Execution Trace
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### Query Analysis Agent
- Classify the query type
- Decide whether the request needs plain retrieval, comparison, troubleshooting, or decomposition
- Select the workflow path

### Retrieval Agent
- Execute first-pass retrieval
- Return candidate chunks plus retrieval metadata
- Prefer recall over precision at this stage

### Reranking Agent
- Reorder the candidate set using stronger relevance logic
- Drop low-value chunks before generation
- Improve precision without forcing the retriever to be overly strict

### Synthesis Agent
- Build the final grounded answer
- Cite the chunks or documents used
- Surface uncertainty when evidence is weak

### Optional Critique Agent
- Check grounding, coverage, and contradiction risk
- Flag weak evidence or missing context
- Trigger another retrieval pass when needed

## Pseudocode

```text
analyze query
choose workflow
retrieve broad candidate set
rerank candidates
synthesize grounded answer
optionally critique and retry
return answer, sources, and trace
```

## When Multi-Agent RAG Is Worth It
- Queries vary widely in type and complexity
- The cost of retrieval mistakes is high
- The system needs traceability across steps
- Different tools or retrieval paths need explicit coordination
- The team wants modular components that can evolve independently

## When It Is Not Worth It
- The workload is simple FAQ or narrow-domain Q&A
- The main bottleneck is chunking or indexing quality
- Latency budgets are tight and multiple stages are too expensive
- The team cannot monitor or debug a more complex workflow

## Operational Guidance

### Start With a Single-Agent Baseline
- Prove that the corpus, chunking, and retrieval are sound first
- Add extra agents only after identifying a real failure pattern

### Keep Agent Boundaries Clear
- Each agent should own one job
- Avoid agents that retrieve, reason, rerank, and answer all at once

### Log the Workflow
- Record which agent ran, what it produced, and why the next step happened
- Multi-agent systems are only useful if they stay debuggable

## Common Failure Modes
- Too many agents with overlapping roles
- Orchestrator logic that is harder to understand than the retrieval problem
- Repeated retrieval loops without clear stopping rules
- Reranking and synthesis both trying to decide relevance independently
- No workflow trace, making failure analysis impossible
