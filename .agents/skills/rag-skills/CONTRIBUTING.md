## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

Only Python 3.10+ is required (the scripts use no third-party packages):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goodnight77/Rag-skills.git
cd Rag-skills
python --version   # 3.10 or newer
```

### Running Validation

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py           # report errors and warnings
python scripts/validate-skills.py --strict  # treat warnings as errors (used in CI)
python scripts/generate-index.py            # regenerate INDEX.md and SKILLS.json
```

## Submitting New Skills

### Step 1: Choose Your Topic

Before creating a new skill, check that:

1. The topic is not already covered by an existing skill
2. The topic is relevant to RAG systems
3. You have practical experience with the topic

### Step 2: Use the Template

Start with [templates/skill-template.md](templates/skill-template.md):
Use the template as a lightweight reference format: brief illustrative text, no long runnable code, and 3-5 external implementation links folded into the relevant sections instead of a separate `References` block.

### Step 3: Place Your Skill

Organize skills by category:

```text
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

For example:

```text
skills/chunking/semantic-chunking/SKILL.md
```

If your category doesn't exist, create it in the appropriate location.

### Step 4: Validate Your Skill

Run the validation script and fix any errors before submitting.

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes
2. Push to your fork
3. Open a pull request with a descriptive title

Example PR title: `Add skill: Semantic Chunking for Markdown Documents`

## Skill Review Criteria

When reviewing skills, maintainers evaluate them against these criteria:

### Clarity

- [ ] Is the problem statement clear and specific?
- [ ] Are key concepts well-defined?
- [ ] Are implementation steps logically ordered?
- [ ] Is the writing free of ambiguity?

### Accuracy

- [ ] Are the technical statements correct?
- [ ] Do code examples run as expected?
- [ ] Are references valid and current?
- [ ] Are the metrics/success criteria realistic?

### Completeness

- [ ] All required sections are present
- [ ] Code examples are brief and illustrative, not full implementations
- [ ] Related skills are properly linked
- [ ] Both use cases and anti-patterns are covered

### Practicality

- [ ] The skill addresses a real-world problem
- [ ] The approach is production-viable
- [ ] The complexity matches the difficulty level
- [ ] Dependencies are reasonable and well-known

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows Python conventions (PEP 8)
- [ ] Code includes comments for complex logic
- [ ] Code handles errors appropriately
- [ ] Code examples stay lightweight and defer to external implementations

## Naming Conventions

### Skill Files

- Use kebab-case directory names: `semantic-chunking/SKILL.md`
- Be descriptive: `hybrid-search-bm25-dense/SKILL.md`
- Keep names under 50 characters

### Categories

Use existing category names:
- `chunking`
- `vector-databases`
- `retrieval-strategies`
- `data-type-handling`
- `performance-optimization`
- `evaluation-metrics`
- `rag-agents`
- `deployment`

### Tags

- Use 3-5 relevant tags per skill
- Use lowercase: `["semantic", "nlp", "context"]`
- Avoid overly specific tags
- Focus on searchable terms

## Testing and Validation

### Local Validation

Before submitting, ensure your skill passes validation:

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py --strict
```

Strict mode treats warnings as errors, which is what CI enforces on every pull
request. Run it locally before you submit so warnings do not fail your build.

### Link Validation

Verify all internal links resolve to real files, and that external implementation
links are placed inline in the relevant step or sentence rather than in a separate
`References` block.

## Credit and Attribution

### Author Field

Include your name in the `author` field of the skill frontmatter:

```yaml
author: "Your Name"
```

### Last Updated

Update the `last_updated` field with the current date (YYYY-MM-DD):

```yaml
last_updated: "2026-05-10"
```

### Co-Authors

For substantial contributions from multiple people, list them in the pull request description:

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, include:

- A clear title
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment information
- Screenshots if applicable

### Issue Templates

#### Bug Report

- What is wrong (broken link, incorrect guidance, validation failure)
- The skill file or path affected
- Steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior

#### Feature Request

- The RAG problem the new skill or change would solve
- Which category it belongs to

- Follow up on responses

### Code Review

- Be constructive in your reviews
- Explain the reasoning for suggested changes
- Acknowledge good work
- Be patient with maintainers' time

### Maintainer Response Time

Maintainers aim to respond to:
- Pull requests: Within 7 days
- Issues: Within 7 days
- Discussions: Within 3 days
